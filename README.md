This script is a more robust tool for scanning websites for cryptocurrency wallets with multiple advanced features

At first run:
1.Check if the required libraries are installed.
2.Install missing libraries using the system's package manager.
3.Import the necessary libraries.
4.Set up the user interface.

Explanation:

    Automatic Installation of Required Packages:
        The script checks if the required packages (tkinter, blockchain, requests) are installed.
        If a package is missing, it automatically installs it using pip.

    Installing Packages:
        install(package): This function uses subprocess.check_call() to run the pip install command in the system’s terminal.
        required_packages: This list contains all the packages the script needs. tkinter is usually pre-installed with Python, so it's mostly there for completeness.

    Importing Libraries:
        After ensuring all packages are installed, the script imports them. This includes the tkinter library for the UI and the blockexplorer from the blockchain library for wallet analysis.

    User Interface:
        The script creates a basic UI using tkinter, allowing users to input wallet addresses and view the analysis results.

How to Run the Script:

    Save the Script: Save the script as a .py file, such as bitcoin_wallet_analyzer.py.

    Run the Script: Execute the script using Python:

    bash

    python bitcoin_wallet_analyzer.py

    Install Required Packages: The script will automatically install any missing packages and then launch the UI.

Considerations:

    Permissions: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to install packages on your system.
    Compatibility: This script assumes a standard Python environment with pip available. On some systems, tkinter may already be installed, but if not, you may need to install it separately.

This script provides a complete solution to automatically set up the environment and run the Bitcoin wallet analyzer with a user interface. Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional features!

Enhancements:

    1.Advanced Wallet Filtering
    2.Progress Feedback
   3.Custom Wallet Patterns
    4.Download and Save Results
    5.Support for Multiple Cryptocurrency Addresses
    6.Improved Error Handling
    7.Detailed Wallet Information
    8.UI Enhancements
    9.Batch URL Processing
    10.Browser Automation (Optional Feature)


Explanation of the Enhancements:

   1. Advanced Wallet Filtering: This script supports filtering by specific cryptocurrency wallet types. By default, it includes patterns for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Users can also add custom regex patterns for other cryptocurrencies.

  2.  Progress Feedback: A progress bar has been added to indicate when the scan is in progress.

   3. Custom Wallet Patterns: Users can add their own regex patterns through the UI to search for specific types of wallets.

  4.  Download and Save Results: A "Save Results" button allows users to save the scan results to a text file.

  5.  Support for Multiple Cryptocurrency Addresses: The script comes with built-in regex patterns for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Users can add more patterns as needed.

   6. Improved Error Handling: The script includes error handling for network requests and invalid input.

  7.  Detailed Wallet Information: The script provides basic wallet details directly in the output area. More detailed information can be added by integrating with a blockchain API.

   8. UI Enhancements: The user interface is more organized, with clear sections for entering URLs, adding custom patterns, and viewing progress.

   9. Batch URL Processing: Users can input multiple URLs at once, and the script will scan each one sequentially.

   10. Browser Automation (Optional): Browser automation would require additional tools like Selenium. If you need this, it can be integrated separately based on the specifics of the task (e.g., navigating multiple pages, logging in, etc.).

11.Browser Automation with Selenium

    Purpose: Automate navigation, logging in, or scraping content from dynamic pages.
    Implementation: Use Selenium for browser automation.

12. API Integration for Detailed Wallet Information

    Purpose: Fetch detailed wallet information using APIs like Blockchain.info or Etherscan.
    Implementation: Add API calls and display the data.

13. Multi-threading for Faster Scanning

    Purpose: Scan multiple URLs simultaneously to speed up the process.
    Implementation: Use Python’s threading or concurrent.futures.

14. Scheduled Scans

    Purpose: Automatically scan at scheduled intervals.
    Implementation: Use Python’s schedule module or cron jobs.

15. Improved UI Layout and Design

    Purpose: Enhance user experience with a modern, accessible UI.
    Implementation: Use tkinter.ttk and custom themes.

16. Logging and Reporting

    Purpose: Maintain logs and generate reports in various formats.
    Implementation: Use Python’s logging module and reportlab or csv.

17. Email Notifications

    Purpose: Notify users of scan results via email.
    Implementation: Use Python’s smtplib for sending emails.

18. Secure URL Handling and Validation

    Purpose: Ensure URLs are safe and valid.
    Implementation: Use urllib.parse and additional security checks.

19. Integration with Databases

    Purpose: Store scan results in a database.
    Implementation: Use SQLite or MySQL with Python’s sqlite3 or mysql.connector.

20. Customizable Scan Parameters

    Purpose: Allow users to set custom scan parameters.
    Implementation: Add UI elements for customization.

21. Graphical Representation of Wallet Data

    Purpose: Visualize wallet data using charts.
    Imple

    mentation: Use matplotlib or plotly.

22. Dark Mode and Accessibility Features

    Purpose: Improve UI accessibility and aesthetics.
    Implementation: Implement theme toggles and accessibility settings.

    11.Browser Automation with Selenium:
        The start_browser function uses Selenium to automate browser tasks, such as opening and navigating web pages.

    12.API Integration:
        The fetch_wallet_details function makes an API call to retrieve details about a Bitcoin wallet.

    13.Multi-threading:
        The script uses ThreadPoolExecutor to scan multiple URLs concurrently.

    14.Scheduled Scans:
        The script schedules daily scans at 10:00 AM using the schedule library.

    15.Improved UI:
        The UI is built using tkinter, with a modern theme and additional controls for adding custom regex patterns, scanning, and saving results.

    16.Logging and Reporting:
        Scanning activity is logged to scanner.log.

    17.Email Notifications:
        The script sends email notifications after a scan is completed (you need to configure SMTP settings).

    18.Secure URL Handling:
        The is_valid_url function ensures only valid URLs are scanned.

    19.Database Integration:
        Wallet data is stored in an SQLite database (wallets.db).

    20.Customizable Scan Parameters:
        Users can add custom regex patterns through the UI.

    21.Graphical Representation:
        The plot_wallet_data function plots wallet data using matplotlib.

    22.Dark Mode:
        A toggle button switches between light and dark themes.
